Enables per-post override of "Automatically close comments on posts older than" option in the WP Discussion Settings.



== Description ==

Override WordPress "automatically close comments" option and leave comments open on any individual posts.


Want to keep comments open on a few old posts? This plugin is for you. Here's how it works:

In the WordPress Discussion Settings, there is an option called "Automatically close comments on posts older than" whatever specified number of days. When this setting is enabled, comments will be disabled on any posts that are past the deadline, whatever "x" number of days.

What WordPress is missing is a simple way to override that global option on a per-post basis. That's exactly what this plugin does. For any post that is past the comment deadline, this plugin will display a small meta box on the "Edit Post" screen for each post. There you can check the box to enable comments on the post. Comments will then remain open for that post indefinitely, until the box is unchecked or the plugin is uninstalled.

__Note:__ The override meta box will not be displayed if the post is not past the comment deadline (whatever "x" number of days).

**Usage**

This plugin does not provide any options page. Instead, it displays a small Meta Box in the sidebar on the "Edit Post" screen. There you can check the box to enable comments on the post. Comments will then remain open for that post indefinitely, until the box is unchecked or the plugin is uninstalled.

__Note:__ The override meta box will not be displayed if the post is not past the comment deadline (whatever "x" number of days).

__Note:__ On the "Edit Post" screen, the override meta box will be displayed in the sidebar or beneath the content editor, depending on how things are configured with the theme, etc.
